Google AI 2010: Tron
====================

This is my entry for the Google AI Challenge (http://tron.aichallenge.org/).

This bot fared pretty well, finishing at the 16th place overall. The final games are still viewable for now at http://tron.aichallenge.org/profile.php?user_id=2540

The strategy used is the classic [iteratively deepened minimax with alpha-beta pruning, using the Voronoi heuristic].

I used the Java language at first, then converted the project to C/C++ for better timing, functions inlining etc.

Code is optimized for performance not readability ;-)
